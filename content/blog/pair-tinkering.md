Pair Tinkering
==============

> Tonight I miss him. I realize he's my tinkering copilot.

> And I need to talk to someone. I need to elaborate some solution. Once
> I find a proper one I can finally forget about the problem, because
> the « only » thing that separates me from the solution is its
> implementation.

> So I need to talk to him. He is the one who helps me design a

> habit I find myself like a lonely pair programmer without his mate.

> This guy is my co-tinkerer and tonight he's not online.
