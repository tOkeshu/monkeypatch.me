As said in the [previous post](/blog/backbone-tnetstrings-0.1.0.html),
I'm working on a neat project called [Fipes](http://fipelines.org), a
web application to share files with your friends without hassles. What
makes Fipes different from other products like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com),
[Box](http://box.com) or even *Open Source* ones like
[SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org/) and
[Syncany](http://www.syncany.org/), is that Fipes is
*privacy-friendly* and *simpler*.

Privacy-Friendly
----------------

The initial idea was to allow anyone to share files by giving a link.
Whereas there is a lot of web applications offering this service, they
often ask you to create an account. Moreover, to share files you need
to upload them to their server, which can be a problem when you feel
that your data or your privacy is a sensible thing. For example,
[think of](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/05/dropbox-ftc/) all
the enterprise related data dropbox could access to.

So what I wanted was something easy to use while respecting my
privacy. That's why I came up with these simple goals:

  - Provide a small web application.
  - Being easy to install, to launch and easy to use.
  - Do **not** keep any sensible data about you or your files.
  - Being free as in freedom, in other words a free software.

To fulfill them, Fipes take a radical approch at the technical level.

How it works?
-------------

Fipes is composed of two parts: a RESTful API written in Erlang with
[Cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) and a JavaScript
application written with
[Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone).

The workflow is easy to grasp:

  1. Choose a file you want to share
  2. Ask the server to generate a public link
  3. Give the link to your friends
  
The fun part is that, until someone use the link you gave them, *the
file is not uploaded to the server*. Indeed, when choosing a file, you
register it on the server but your browser does not send any file data
yet.

So what happen when someone use the link? The server send to your
browser a message asking for the file data. Then the JavaScript
application slices the file in several parts and send them to the
server.

As Fipes does not want to keep any file data, as soon as the server
receive chunks it forward them to the downloader.

On the downloader side, the file is retrieved via a simple chunked
response.

Here is a little recap with a sequence diagram:

Further explanations and what's next
------------------------------------

What the Fipes model implies is that the user experience is synchronous.
Indeed, if you quit the page, the files you offer are not available anymore.
Thus you need to let the page open until your friends got the whole file.

Another side effect of the « lazy upload » technique is that you don't
have to wait for the whole file to be uploaded to share it with your
friends.

There is still more work to do on Fipes to achieves its goals, but I
hope it will be useful to others. In the next weeks I'll work on some
features, like the support of download resuming or a https version for
[the online instance](http://fipelines.org). However the most
important parts will be UI related as the current version is not fully
understandable.

As Fipes is a free software, any
[contribution](http://github.com/tOkeshu/fipes) is of course very
welcome :)
